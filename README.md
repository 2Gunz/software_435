# Crownpoint Healthcare Facilities Scheduling App
This repository contains the code for an employee scheduling app designed for Crownpoint Healthcare Facilities as part of ECE 435: Software Engineering. Our app is written in python and uses the flask framework to communicate with a MySQL database. Users will be able to register and login to submit a request form designating their shift preferences. This information will be taken into consideration as our backend algorithms schedule employees for the month. Once the scheduling magic is done, the app will produce a  calendar that can be shared with Crownpoint faculty. To take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing, we will be deploying our app using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some of benefits include customization, scalability, availability, and reliability.   
**At this point in time, our code is in the development stages. Please check back to see the finished product.**
