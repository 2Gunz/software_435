# Crownpoint Healthcare Facilities Scheduling App  
  
This repository contains the code for an employee scheduling app designed for Crownpoint Healthcare Facilities as part of ECE 435: Software Engineering. Our app is written in python and uses the flask framework to communicate with a MySQL database over http(s). Users will be able to register and login to a dashboard with CRUD abilities to submit a request form designating their shift preferences for the month. This information will be taken into consideration as our backend algorithms schedule employees for the month. Once the scheduling magic is done, the app will produce a calendar that can be shared with Crownpoint faculty. To take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing, we will be deploying our app using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some benefits include customization, scalability, availability, and reliability. **At this point our code is still in the development stages, please check back for the finished product.**
